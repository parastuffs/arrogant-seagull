That's one arrogant seagull.

What's the plan?
------------

The main idea is to have an online system allowing to store the courses notes.

The project should have those different features:

* Online mysql database.
* Allow different users.
* A user can only see his notes.
* A user with administration privileges can manage courses.
* Admin can add, delete, edit a course.
* A course has those properties:
	* Name.
	* Identifier (like INFO-F-404).
	* ECTS.
	* Note of the course.
* Note fields are the different way of adding a note to a course (exam, project, etc.) and has the following properties:
	* Denomination.
	* Note.
	* Percentage of the total note.
	* Max of the note.
